# CLAUDE.md

Project-level instructions for Claude Code sessions working on plato.

## Project overview

plato is an Open Source, AI-powered [microlearning](https://philosophers.group/platos-microlearning/) platform. Learners work through focused lessons in a continuous conversation with an AI coach, designed for completion in ~20 minutes.

- `client/` — React 19 + Vite SPA
- `server/` — Node.js + Hono, deployed as AWS Lambda (SAM)
- Brand: "plato" (always lowercase)

## Architecture

- Login required — all data server-side, no offline mode
- Auth: JWT access tokens (15 min) + refresh tokens (30 day), stored in localStorage (`plato_auth`). Login accepts email or username
- Users have a unique `username` (auto-generated if not set, editable, 3-30 chars alphanumeric/hyphens/underscores)
- 2 Lambda functions: API Gateway (buffered CRUD) + Function URL (streaming SSE for AI chat)
- 5 DynamoDB tables: users, invites, refresh-tokens, sync-data, audit-log
- Content stored as `_system` sync-data: `prompt:*`, `lesson:*`, `knowledgeBase`, `settings`
- Prompts are bundled in `client/prompts/*.md` and upserted to DB on every server startup — admins cannot edit prompts directly
- User-created lessons stored under user's own sync-data: `lessons:custom-*`
- 8 AI agents via Bedrock or Anthropic API (prompt files in `client/prompts/`). Each prompt file has an HTML comment header documenting what it reads, who calls it, and its purpose:
  - **coach** — Reads: lesson prompt, lesson KB, learner profile, program KB. The main learner-facing agent.
  - **lesson-creator** — Reads: program KB. Helps admins design lessons via conversation.
  - **lesson-owner** — Reads: lesson prompt, learner profile. Initializes per-lesson KB.
  - **lesson-extractor** — Reads: conversation text only. Extracts lesson markdown from creation chat.
  - **knowledge-base-editor** — Reads: program KB. Helps admins create/edit the KB via conversation.
  - **knowledge-base-extractor** — Reads: existing KB + conversation. Merges changes into updated KB markdown.
  - **learner-profile-owner** — Reads: learner profile, lesson KB. Full profile update on lesson completion.
  - **learner-profile-update** — Reads: learner profile, activity context. Incremental profile updates during lessons.
- Program Knowledge Base is appended to agent system prompts at runtime for agents in `KB_AGENTS` (`client/js/orchestrator.js`)
- Lesson visibility: lessons have three statuses — `public` (visible to all), `private` (visible only to users in `sharedWith`), and `draft` (in-progress, admin-only, no markdown yet). Drafts surface as a `Draft` pill in Admin → Lessons and are never exposed to learner-facing endpoints. A record is a true draft iff `status === 'draft'` AND markdown is empty; legacy `status: 'draft'` records that *do* have markdown are treated as `private` to preserve pre-rework semantics. Legacy `published` normalizes to `public`.
- Courses: optional taxonomy for grouping lessons. Each course is a first-class `_system:course:<id>` sync-data record with `{ name }`. Each lesson carries an optional `course` field (course ID, like `userGroup` on users). Pure organization — courses don't carry visibility/ACL; lesson visibility is unchanged. The learner-facing `GET /v1/lessons` and `/v1/lessons/:id` endpoints inline `course: { id, name } | null` so the coach context (`buildContext` in `client/src/lib/lessonEngine.js`) can include `course: { name }` when assigned. Admin manages courses via a "Courses" button on Admin → Lessons (mirrors the User Groups pattern on Admin → Users) which opens an accessible modal for create/edit/delete; the lesson editor has a course dropdown that persists changes immediately on edit, and the lessons table has a Course column. Course delete cascades: any lesson whose `course` field referenced the deleted course is rewritten with `course: null`.
- Learner classroom (`/lessons`, `client/src/pages/LessonsList.jsx`): lessons render as a responsive grid (1 col mobile / 2 col sm: / 3 col lg:) with 12 per page. A course filter dropdown sits above the grid; it's hidden when no courses exist (saves screen space in classrooms that don't use the taxonomy). When the filter is set to a course that no longer exists (e.g. the only course was just deleted), the filter snaps back to "All courses" automatically. Filter and page changes are announced to screen readers via an always-mounted `role="status" aria-live="polite"` region — no visible "N lessons" subhead, since sighted users get the same signal from the grid shifting and the pagination row.
- Lesson Catalog appended at runtime: public lessons for `PUBLIC_CATALOG_AGENTS` (coach), all lessons with `[PRIVATE]` tags for `ADMIN_CATALOG_AGENTS` (lesson-creator, knowledge-base-editor)
- Microlearning constraints defined in `client/src/lib/constants.js`: MAX_EXCHANGES=11, MIN_OBJECTIVES=2, MAX_OBJECTIVES=4. Server mirrors in `server/src/lib/lesson-limits.js`. Prompts reference these as literal numbers (update both if changed).
- Pacing: lessons target 11 exchanges (~20 min). **There is no hard cutoff** — lessons always run until the coach awards progress 10. The coach gets escalating `pacingDirective` nudges in the context JSON (at 8+, 11+, 15+, 20+) but these are suggestions, never orders. `client/src/lib/lessonEngine.js` must never auto-complete a lesson based on exchange count; only `parsed.progress >= 10` triggers completion. Philosophy: "move people, not force people" — the coach can always introduce new scaffolding if the learner needs it. `extendedLessons` (completions at 22+ exchanges) is informational only — it signals lesson-design mismatch, not a metric to drive to zero.
- Post-completion feedback mode: once `lessonKB.status === 'completed'`, the thread is feedback-only. `activitiesCompleted` freezes (it's the learning-exchange counter, not a total-turn counter — post-completion chatter doesn't count and would corrupt the `extendedLessons` KPI if it did). `pacingDirective` is suppressed and `postCompletionDirective` replaces it, telling the coach never to coach, assess, or award progress for a *different* lesson inside the same thread. `achieved` is one-shot — only true on the transition turn — so completion side effects (confetti, completion profile update) don't re-fire on subsequent feedback messages. The pure helper `applyCoachResponseToKB` in `lessonEngine.js` is the single owner of this invariant.
- Classroom branding (colors, logo, name) stored in `_system` settings, fetched via `/v1/branding` (public, no auth)
- Admin dashboard at `/plato` (lazy-loaded, role-gated) with Lesson Pacing KPIs (on-target rate, over-target count, extended-lesson count)
- Server logging: `server/src/lib/logger.js` — ring-buffer logger keyed by snake_case `code` strings (not free-form messages). Each call mirrors a structured JSON line to stdout that includes `logId`, so Lambda → CloudWatch captures the same shape and the endpoint can dedupe events retrieved from both lanes. `GET /v1/admin/logs` merges the in-process buffer with CloudWatch (Lambda has `logs:FilterLogEvents` scoped to `/aws/lambda/${AWS::StackName}-*` plus `logs:DescribeLogGroups` on `*` since that action doesn't support per-group scoping). The log-group prefix for queries is derived from stage (prod → `/aws/lambda/plato-`, playground → `/aws/lambda/plato-playground-`) to match CloudFormation's naming — the prod stack is bare `plato`, not `plato-prod`. CloudWatch is queried with two required-term patterns (`ERROR` and `"Task timed out"`) — never the all-optional `?FOO ?BAR` form, which CloudWatch treats as match-everything. The pilot agent (via `scripts/pilot-report.js`) is the primary consumer: response is pre-aggregated into `groups` by code with counts, firstSeen/lastSeen, and a sample entry, and the pilot workflow itself no longer needs AWS credentials (no `AWS_ROLE_ARN` secret, no `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` step — all log reads are proxied through the endpoint via admin JWT). CloudWatch failures populate `cloudwatch.error` instead of silently returning empty.

## Plugins

plato has a manifest-driven plugin system modeled on VS Code/Vite/WordPress patterns. Plugins live in `plugins/<id>/` and are bundled into the SAM build (no runtime code uploads — Lambda's read-only FS rules that out). The admin UI at `/plato/plugins` lets admins toggle activation and configure plugins.

```
plugins/
  slack/                       # built-in plugin (the Slack invite UI lives here, not in admin.js)
  ...
docs/plugins/
  README.md                    # quickstart
  AUTHORING.md                 # human guide
  AGENTS.md                    # AI-agent guide (decision tree, recipes, DO-NOT list)
  EXTENSION_REFERENCE.md       # flat reference of every slot/hook/capability
  CAPABILITIES.md              # capability vocabulary + audit guidance
  API_VERSIONING.md            # semver policy + deprecation window
  EXAMPLES.md                  # walkthroughs at increasing complexity
  plugin.schema.json           # machine-readable manifest spec
  templates/                   # copy-paste-ready code templates
packages/plugin-sdk/index.d.ts # TypeScript types for plugin authors
server/src/lib/plugins/        # plugin host: registry, manifest, hooks, lifecycle, logger, sdk
client/src/lib/plugins/        # client host: loader, <PluginSlot>, SettingsForm
scripts/
  create-plato-plugin.js       # scaffolder
  validate-plugins.js          # CI gate (validates every manifest)
```

**Anti-goals (plugins MUST NOT):** override completion semantics (`applyCoachResponseToKB` is the single owner), introduce hard exchange-count cutoffs, write to `_system:settings.*` directly, read or write another plugin's settings, mount routes outside `/v1/plugins/<id>/`, modify files outside their own `plugins/<id>/` folder.

**When changing the plugin contract:** bump `PLUGIN_API_VERSION` in `server/src/lib/plugins/version.js`, update `docs/plugins/plugin.schema.json` capability/slot/hook enums, update `packages/plugin-sdk/index.d.ts` types, update `docs/plugins/EXTENSION_REFERENCE.md`. The capability vocabulary table in `docs/plugins/CAPABILITIES.md` is the single source of truth for what's documented vs. what's implemented.

**Core plugin tests** live alongside each plugin (`plugins/<id>/server/*.test.js`). Plugin host tests live at `server/tests/lib/plugins/*.test.js`.

## Development

```bash
cd client && npm install && cd ../server && npm install
cd server && cp .env.example .env   # add your Anthropic API key
node dev-sqlite.js
```

Client hot reload: `cd client && npm run dev` (port 5173, proxies API to :3000)

## Testing

```bash
cd server && npm test
```

124 tests. AI route tests mock `ai-provider.js` (not `bedrock.js`).

## Deploy to AWS

```bash
cd client && npm ci && npm run build
cd ../server && sam build
cp -r ../client/dist .aws-sam/build/PlatoStreamFunction/client-dist
cp -r ../client/dist .aws-sam/build/PlatoApiFunction/client-dist
mkdir -p .aws-sam/build/PlatoApiFunction/client-content .aws-sam/build/PlatoStreamFunction/client-content
cp -r ../client/prompts ../client/data .aws-sam/build/PlatoApiFunction/client-content/
cp -r ../client/prompts ../client/data .aws-sam/build/PlatoStreamFunction/client-content/
# Plugins (server-side) — the registry walks plugins/<id>/server/index.js at boot
cp -r ../plugins .aws-sam/build/PlatoApiFunction/plugins
cp -r ../plugins .aws-sam/build/PlatoStreamFunction/plugins
# version.json is generated at deploy time from the latest Beta-RC-* tag
VERSION=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 --match='Beta-RC-*' 2>/dev/null || echo 'Beta-RC-0')
echo "{\"version\":\"${VERSION}\"}" > .aws-sam/build/PlatoApiFunction/version.json
cp .aws-sam/build/PlatoApiFunction/version.json .aws-sam/build/PlatoStreamFunction/version.json
sam deploy
```

The copy steps are required — SAM doesn't build the client. `client-dist` serves the SPA; `client-content` provides prompt and lesson source files for seeding.

Deploy config: `server/samconfig.toml` (copy from `samconfig.toml.example`, gitignored). See README.md for full deploy guide including CI/CD setup.

### Environments

The `template.yaml` accepts a `Stage` parameter (`prod` or `playground`). Each stage gets its own DynamoDB tables and SSM parameters:

- **prod** (`plato` stack) — learn.ai-leaders.org, auto-deploys on push to `main` (via `repository_dispatch` → private fork)
- **playground** (`plato-playground` stack) — playground.ai-leaders.org, auto-deploys on push to `playground` (via `repository_dispatch` → private fork)

SSM parameters (per stage): `/plato/{stage}/jwt-secret`, `/plato/{stage}/admin-email`, `/plato/{stage}/admin-password`, `/plato/{stage}/ses-from-email`, `/plato/{stage}/app-url`

### Backups

Prod DynamoDB tables have two backup layers:

- **PITR** (Point-in-Time Recovery) — continuous, restores to any second in the last 35 days
- **Pre-deploy snapshots** — the prod deploy workflow creates on-demand backups of all 5 tables before each deploy, keeping the last 5 per table

## CloudFront

The site is served via CloudFront -> Lambda Function URL. The Origin Request Policy **must** be `AllViewerExceptHostHeader` — Lambda Function URLs reject requests where the Host header doesn't match their domain.

## Conventions

- Accessibility is required: every interactive element must be keyboard-operable and have an accessible name (aria-label, aria-pressed, role, etc.)
- Chat accessibility: the chat log uses `role="log"` with `aria-live="off"` and `aria-label="Chat log"` to prevent VoiceOver hijacking. New message announcements go through a separate `role="status"` live region that auto-clears ~3s after each announcement so stale text doesn't persist as navigable content. Streaming `AssistantMessage` components must set `streaming` prop to hide from screen readers. Individual messages are plain `<div>`s (no `role="article"`, no per-message `aria-label`) with inline sr-only speaker prefixes ("Coach says:" / "You said:") that flow as content, plus `data-chat-message` attributes for Alt+Arrow keyboard navigation (`useChatKeyboardNav` hook). The Objectives dialog moves focus to its title on open so screen readers announce the dialog's purpose. `useTitleNotification` hook flashes document title for background tab notifications. `ComposeBar` sends on Cmd/Ctrl+Enter; plain Enter inserts a newline.
- Always commit and push after changes
- **PR workflow for collaborative iteration**: when implementing a feature interactively with a user (multi-turn iteration, browser testing, UX tweaks), open the PR as **Draft** (`gh pr create --draft`) — or hold commits locally and don't open a PR yet. Only mark Ready (`gh pr ready <n>`) when the user explicitly says it's ready to ship. If a Ready PR is already open and more iteration starts, convert it back to Draft (`gh pr ready <n> --undo`). Reason: every push to a Ready PR triggers the full CI suite (auto-review on Bedrock, CodeQL, lint × 2). Micro-commits during design iteration produce noise on the PR timeline and waste Bedrock budget. This rule does NOT apply to plato-pilot PRs (`pilot.yml` opens them Ready by design — they're standalone proposals, not iteration loops) or to one-line bugfixes the user already approved up front.
- Run `npm test` before deploying
- Version is tag-based (`Beta-RC-X`). On push to main, `.github/workflows/version-bump.yml` creates the next `Beta-RC-N` git tag + GitHub release. There's no `version.json` tracked in git — the deploy workflow generates it from the latest tag before packaging Lambda. Local dev: no version.json means the admin sidebar hides the version label; that's intentional.
- Deploy workflows live only in the private fork (UIC-OSF/learn.ai-leaders.org), not in the public repo. Deploys are automated via `repository_dispatch`: pushing to `main` here triggers `.github/workflows/trigger-deploy.yml`, which fires a `deploy-prod` dispatch to the private fork; pushing to `playground` fires `deploy-playground`. The private fork's `deploy.yml` / `deploy-playground.yml` listen for those events, check this repo out at the dispatched SHA, and run SAM deploy. No more pushing to the deploy remote. One-time setup: a `DEPLOY_DISPATCH_TOKEN` secret on this repo (fine-grained PAT with `contents:write` on the deploy fork). Manual deploy: run `Trigger Deploy` here via `workflow_dispatch` with a `target` input (`prod` / `playground` / `both` — `both` fires simultaneous deploys to both envs), or run `Deploy to AWS` / `Deploy to Playground` directly from the private fork's Actions tab with an optional `ref` input (branch/tag/SHA on this repo).
- `main` and `playground` are ruleset-protected (required PR + 1 approving review + passing `review` status check from the Code Review workflow; no force pushes; no deletion). Blake as repository admin is on the bypass list with `bypass_mode: always` for emergency overrides.
- Auto code review: `.github/workflows/code-review.yml` runs on every PR (opened + synchronize) and posts a review as `claude[bot]`. Reviews are per-commit idempotent: the guard step queries existing reviews and skips when a `claude[bot]` review already exists for the current head sha. New commits (different sha) — including `revise.yml`'s fixup pushes — still get reviewed. The job still completes when skipped so the required `review` status check is satisfied. The reviewer prompt explicitly instructs the agent to submit exactly ONE `gh pr review` call (the agent was previously double-posting inside a single run). Reviewers must call out live-user impact explicitly and end every review body with a one-line `User impact:` summary — because merges auto-deploy to prod, the review is the last human-free checkpoint. A post-action verify step fails the job if the agent exits without posting a review (caught a silent-no-op failure mode where the SDK returns success but never calls `gh pr review`). Only one automated reviewer should be active at a time; if the hosted Claude GitHub App (github.com/apps/claude) is also installed with auto-review enabled, disable it there to prevent duplicate reviews.
- Issue intake: `.github/workflows/issue-intake.yml` runs on every newly opened issue and classifies it as either `ready-for-pilot` or `needs-info`. To qualify as `ready-for-pilot`, the issue must name something concrete: an exact string/copy change, a specific error message or screenshot, or a named component plus observed-vs-expected behavior. Vague reports ("updated headings needed", "make X better") go to `needs-info` with ≤3 clarifying questions — a false-positive `needs-info` is cheap, a false-positive `ready-for-pilot` fuels pilot loops. Non-bug issues get no label, no comment. Idempotent via the labels.
- plato-pilot: `.github/workflows/pilot.yml` runs weekday mornings (ET). Per run, it reads `/tmp/pilot-report.md` (KPIs, error codes, open pilot PRs as a **blocklist of issues with an open PR**, pilot merge-rate track record, tier-classified `ready-for-pilot` issues with each issue's author surfaced as `(by @login)` or `_(self-filed)_`), then picks ONE signal or SKIPs. **Strict picking order** (top-down — first match wins, no jumping ahead because something later looks higher-impact): (1) community-authored `ready-for-pilot` issue (author ≠ `plato-pilot`), tier-ranked then oldest-first; (2) self-filed `ready-for-pilot` issue; (3) high-count server error on a learner-facing surface; (4) KPI signal. Volume is not a tie-breaker against authored issues — a one-line community issue beats a 50-instance error. When the pick is issue-driven, the agent commits with a `Co-Authored-By: <issue-author> <login@users.noreply.github.com>` trailer so GitHub credits the issue author as a contributor on the merge commit. Tiers: 1 (learner experience: exemplars, coach, profiles) → 5 (DevOps). Every pilot PR body must include a Triage table (Signal / Source / Tier / Decision / Why) plus a `User impact: low/medium/high` line so the maintainer can audit blast radius at a glance. The blocklist is built from **every open PR** that references an issue via `Fixes/Closes/Resolves #N`, not just `plato-pilot`-labeled PRs — so a maintainer-authored PR claiming a `ready-for-pilot` issue blocks the pilot from racing it (closing the dup-gap that produced #160). A pre-agent step emits the blocklist to `/tmp/pilot-blocklist.txt` and a post-agent step closes any PR that references a blocked issue (hard dup-gate — the advisory prose version was repeatedly ignored). A final step auto-escalates looping issues: when ≥2 closed-unmerged pilot PRs reference the same `ready-for-pilot` issue, the step removes the label, adds `needs-info`, and posts a comment asking the reporter to clarify. Anti-goals (never violate): no hard lesson cutoffs, no pacing directive tightening, `extendedLessons` is informational only.
- Claude workflow auth: `pilot.yml`, `code-review.yml`, `issue-intake.yml`, and `revise.yml` all use **AWS Bedrock via OIDC**. Each job has `id-token: write`, runs `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4` to assume `${{ secrets.AWS_BEDROCK_ROLE_ARN }}` in `us-east-2`, then passes `use_bedrock: "true"` to `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1`. Models are pinned via `--model` in `claude_args` to Bedrock cross-region inference profiles: `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0` for review/pilot, `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0` for intake/revise. The role is `arn:aws:iam::722741357267:role/plato-github-bedrock` (separate AWS account from prod plato). Bedrock cross-region inference profiles route across us-east-1/us-east-2/us-west-2, so model access must be granted in all three regions on the role's account. No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secrets are used — Bedrock is the only auth lane. (Earlier OAuth attempts failed with 401 from the Anthropic API; rather than wait for the Anthropic-side bug to clear, the workflows route through Bedrock's IAM auth instead.)
- API responses for user groups use `{ userGroups: [...] }` consistently
- Emails use classroom name/colors from settings, with "Powered by plato." footer linking to GitHub
- Auth pages (login, signup, forgot-password, reset-password) use `usePublicBranding` hook for classroom theming
- Classroom pages use `BrandingProvider` context
- Admin pages (`/plato/*`) are never themed with classroom branding
- Footer text: "Powered by plato." (with period, with GitHub link)
- User-created lesson IDs start with `custom-`
- `loadLessons()` merges system lessons (`/v1/lessons`) with user lessons from sync-data
- Favicon: defaults to plato's; generated dynamically when admin uploads a logo image (logo on rounded-rect with primary color)
- Lesson visibility: new lessons start as `draft` the moment the Lesson Creator conversation begins (one `lesson:<id>` record per draft in `_system` sync-data), so admins can pause a draft and resume it later, or work on multiple drafts in parallel. Clicking "Create Lesson" finalizes the same record with extracted markdown and flips status `draft` → `private` (shared only with author). Admins toggle public/private on finalized lessons and manage shared users via the Share modal. Drafts hide the Share icon since there's nothing shareable yet.
- No admin lesson preview — admins preview lessons by sharing with themselves and viewing in the classroom
- Lesson editing: conversation-based via the Lesson Creator agent (no raw markdown editor)
- Knowledge base: created/edited by admins via the KB Editor agent in the Customizer (not directly editable)
- Admin nav order: Home, Lessons, Users, Customizer, Plugins (course management lives inside Admin → Lessons)
