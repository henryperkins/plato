# plato Architecture — subsystem deep-dives

Detailed design notes and incident history for plato's load-bearing subsystems.
`CLAUDE.md` carries the one-line invariants; this doc carries the *why* and the
*how it broke*. Read the relevant section before changing one of these systems.

## Data & content model

- Login required — all data is server-side, no offline mode. Auth: JWT access
  tokens (15 min) + refresh tokens (30 day), stored in localStorage
  (`plato_auth`). Login accepts email or username. Users have a unique
  `username` (auto-generated if unset, editable, 3–30 chars
  alphanumeric/hyphens/underscores).
- 2 Lambda functions: API Gateway (buffered CRUD) + Function URL (streaming SSE
  for AI chat).
- 5 DynamoDB tables: users, invites, refresh-tokens, sync-data, audit-log.
- Content stored as `_system` sync-data: `prompt:*`, `lesson:*`,
  `knowledgeBase`, `settings`.
- Prompts are bundled in `client/prompts/*.md` and upserted to DB on every
  server startup — admins cannot edit prompts directly.
- User-created lessons stored under the user's own sync-data:
  `lessons:custom-*`. User-created lesson IDs start with `custom-`.
- Classroom branding (colors, logo, name) stored in `_system` settings, fetched
  via `/v1/branding` (public, no auth).

## AI agents

9 AI agents via Bedrock or Anthropic API (prompt files in `client/prompts/`).
Each prompt file has an HTML comment header documenting what it reads, who calls
it, and its purpose:

- **coach** — Reads: lesson prompt, lesson KB, learner profile, program KB, course name + cross-lesson progress note. The main learner-facing agent.
- **lesson-creator** — Reads: program KB. Helps admins design lessons via conversation (and is aware lessons can belong to a persistent course).
- **lesson-owner** — Reads: lesson prompt, learner profile. Initializes per-lesson KB.
- **lesson-extractor** — Reads: conversation text only. Extracts lesson markdown from creation chat.
- **knowledge-base-editor** — Reads: program KB. Helps admins create/edit the KB via conversation.
- **knowledge-base-extractor** — Reads: existing KB + conversation. Merges changes into updated KB markdown. **Summarizes, doesn't transcribe** — it produces a concise reference (a few KB), because the full KB is re-appended to every coach turn and an unbounded KB overflows the context window (and silently truncates against the extractor's own `maxTokens`). The editor (`AdminCustomizer`/`AdminKBSetup`) windows live turns to the last 15, like the lesson creator.
- **learner-profile-owner** — Reads: learner profile, lesson KB. Full profile update on lesson completion. Only revises the "soft" fields (name, goal, strengths, weaknesses, preferences, summary); `masteredLessons`/`activeLessons` are **stripped from its input and not requested in its output** — they are system-managed bookkeeping arrays that grow without bound, and `mergeProfile` reunions them from the stored profile. The completion path records the just-mastered `lessonId` in code (`profileQueue.js`). Echoing those arrays used to inflate the agent's JSON past `maxTokens`, truncating it into an unparseable response (#228).
- **learner-profile-update** — Reads: learner profile (minus the bookkeeping arrays), activity context. Incremental profile updates during lessons; same soft-fields-only contract as `learner-profile-owner`.
- **course-progress-update** — Reads: prior course summary, just-completed lesson KB, course lesson list. Maintains the per-learner `courseProgress:<courseId>` note injected into the coach as `course.progress`.

Context appended at runtime (`client/js/orchestrator.js`):

- **Program Knowledge Base** appended to agent system prompts for agents in `KB_AGENTS`.
- **Lesson Catalog**: public lessons for `PUBLIC_CATALOG_AGENTS` (coach); all
  lessons with `[PRIVATE]` tags for `ADMIN_CATALOG_AGENTS` (lesson-creator,
  knowledge-base-editor).
- Knowledge base is created/edited by admins via the KB Editor agent in the
  Customizer (not directly editable).

## Image & conversation persistence (#191, #193)

A learner's chat history for a lesson lives in one `messages:<lessonId>`
sync-data record (append-only via `saveLessonMessages`); progress lives
separately in `lessonKB:<lessonId>`.

**Pasted/uploaded images are NOT embedded in the messages record.** Each image
is its own `screenshot:<key>` record, and the message stores only
`metadata.imageKeys`. This is load-bearing:

- DynamoDB caps a single item at 400 KB. Inlining base64 screenshots blew the
  `messages:` record past that limit. The write then failed, but
  `client/js/storage.js`'s `putSyncData` swallowed the non-409 error, so the
  in-memory cache looked fine until the next `loadAll()` (on tab refocus)
  replaced it with the stale server copy — the learner's conversation silently
  vanished while the small `lessonKB` record survived.
- Images are compressed client-side on paste
  (`client/src/lib/imageCompression.js`) to stay well under the per-record
  limit, persisted one-per-record, and excluded from the bulk `GET /v1/sync`
  payload (fetched on demand by key).
- `ComposeBar.addImagesFromFiles` reads files via `FileReader` with
  `Promise.allSettled` (not `all`) so one unreadable file can't discard a whole
  batch, and surfaces the underlying `DOMException.name` in the alert
  (e.g. `NotReadableError` = file locked by antivirus / in use, `NotFoundError`
  = a OneDrive "files on-demand" entry not downloaded locally). Reads can also
  be blocked by a browser extension injecting a content script into the page.
  The opaque "Failed to read image" message that hid all of this was issue #228.
- `resumeLesson` re-hydrates `imageKeys` → data URLs for rendering via
  `hydrateMessageImages`. Legacy messages that still embed `imageDataUrls`
  directly render unchanged.
- A lazy, idempotent migration (`migrateLegacyImages`, run from `resumeLesson`)
  heals pre-fix conversations whose embedded base64 already bloated the record:
  it extracts each embedded image into a compressed `screenshot:*` record and
  rewrites the conversation record slim so the lesson can be continued. The
  migration is **skipped while impersonating** (`resumeLesson` must stay
  read-only for the "View as User" audit — writes lack `?asUserId` and would
  land on the admin's own account).
- `putSyncData` returns a durability boolean and logs rejected/failed writes
  instead of swallowing them.
- The `LessonChat` resume effect keys on stable values (`lessonGroupId`, lesson
  presence) — **never the `lesson` object identity**, which changes on every tab
  refocus and used to re-run the effect and reset the conversation mid-lesson.

## Link attachments

A learner attaches a web page to a coach message via a link button in
`ComposeBar` (next to the image button). Fetching + extraction happen
**server-side** — the browser can't fetch cross-origin pages (CORS), and
server-side is where the SSRF defense must live.

- **Endpoint:** `POST /v1/links/fetch` (`server/src/routes/links.js`, buffered
  API function); `client/src/lib/links.js`'s `fetchLinkContent` calls it on
  attach so the chip shows the real title immediately.
- **Extraction** (`server/src/lib/link-extractor.js`): `fetchUrlContent` does a
  plain fetch, `extractReadable` runs `@mozilla/readability` over a `linkedom`
  DOM and converts the cleaned HTML to block-preserving text (Readability's
  `textContent` fuses words across elements), falling back to a whole-body strip
  for non-article pages. This is the **pluggable seam** — swap only the fetch
  step for a headless browser / reader service to handle JS-rendered SPAs later
  (the **known v1 gap**: SPAs return little text).
- **SSRF defense** (`server/src/lib/url-guard.js`) — the headline risk, since
  the server fetches user URLs from inside AWS. http/https + port allowlist, no
  embedded credentials; rejects any loopback/private/link-local/reserved address
  (incl. `169.254.169.254` and every IPv6 representation of those ranges —
  compressed, expanded, hex/dotted IPv4-mapped); manual redirects (≤5 hops)
  re-validated each hop; 10 s timeout, 3 MB cap, content-type allowlist, ~50 k
  char truncation. **DNS rebinding is closed by pinning:** the fetch agent's
  `connect.lookup` (`safeLookup`) validates the resolved address and the socket
  connects to *that* IP, so a low-TTL host can't pass an up-front check then
  re-resolve to an internal IP (the classic resolve-then-fetch TOCTOU). Uses
  undici's own `fetch` + `Agent` (Node's built-in `fetch` rejects an external
  undici dispatcher).
- **Link text is untrusted, user-controlled content.** It's whatever the linked
  page says, so it can contain prompt-injection attempts ("ignore previous
  instructions…"). It's framed to the coach as `[REFERENCE CONTEXT — Learner
  attached a web page for your review]` with an explicit trailing instruction
  that this is reference material, not evidence of completion unless the learner
  confirms it. Claude is generally robust to injection, but treat page content
  as untrusted — don't add code paths that act on it as instructions.
- **Recall is this-turn-only (image parity).** `buildUserParts` (`lessonEngine.js`)
  injects the page text into the coach call on the attach turn (ordered text →
  links → images); it's never persisted or re-sent (later turns see a `[link]`
  placeholder). Only `metadata.links: [{ url, title }]` is persisted — so no
  400 KB risk, no new sync record, no hydration; chips render straight from that
  metadata on resume.
- **Coach interpretation guidance** (`client/prompts/coach.md`): the prompt
  explicitly tells the coach NOT to treat page content as evidence of completion
  unless the learner confirms it — e.g., if a lesson asks them to publish a blog
  post and they share their site, the coach should ask "Is this the published
  post you're submitting?" rather than assuming visible content is final. This
  prevents the hallucination failure mode where a learner shares their
  work-in-progress portfolio site for reference and the coach infers completion
  from content that doesn't exist or isn't finished yet.

## Invite system

Admins invite users via email or shareable link. Invites expire after 7 days (TTL enforced in DynamoDB/SQLite). All invite operations are audit-logged.

### Email invites

- **Creation:** `POST /v1/admin/invites` (single) or `/v1/admin/invites/bulk` (up to 200). Bulk supports CSV upload.
- **Delivery:** SES email (`server/src/lib/email.js`) with signup URL: `{APP_URL}/signup?token={inviteToken}`.
- **Validation:** Invite token must exist, status `pending`, TTL not expired, and **email must match** the invite.
- **One-time:** Marked `used` on signup; cannot be reused.

### Link invites (shareable, reusable)

Added to enable bulk onboarding without collecting emails upfront (e.g., sharing in company Slack channels).

- **Creation:** `POST /v1/admin/invites/link` creates a single organization-wide link. If one exists, it's deleted first (regenerate = delete old + create new).
- **Retrieval:** `GET /v1/admin/invites/link` returns the active link or `null`.
- **Deletion:** `DELETE /v1/admin/invites/link` revokes the link immediately.
- **Schema:** Same `invites` table, but `email: null` and `isLink: true`. Added fields: `usageCount` (incremented on each signup), `maxUsages` (optional limit, currently `null` = unlimited).
- **Validation:** Any email accepted (vs. email invites that must match). TTL and status still checked.
- **Usage tracking:** `incrementLinkUsage()` atomically increments `usageCount` on signup with a conditional update that enforces `maxUsages` if set. This prevents race conditions where concurrent signups could exceed the limit. The check-then-increment at the route level would be racy; the database operation is the authoritative gate. Link is marked `used` only if `maxUsages` reached (rare; currently unlimited).
- **Security:** 7-day TTL, audit-logged, clear UI warnings about sharing risks, email still required at signup (no anonymous accounts).
- **UI:** Admin → Users → Invite Users → "Link" tab. Shows URL with copy button, usage stats, expiry date, and security warning. Regenerate/delete actions have confirmations.

### Signup flow

`POST /v1/auth/signup` accepts `inviteToken`, `email`, `name`, `password`, `username` (optional), `userGroup` (optional).

- **Email invites:** `email` must match `invite.email`.
- **Link invites:** `email` can be any valid address (required field).
- Both check TTL expiration, duplicate user, and username availability. On success, user is auto-logged in and invite is marked used (or usage count incremented for link invites).

Plugins can enrich lessons at start time by providing additional reference
material — e.g., WordPress docs, React API updates, internal knowledge bases.
Enrichment is computed **once** when the learner starts the lesson (after Lesson
Owner KB init, before Coach opens), cached on `lessonKB.enrichments`, and
injected into the coach's system context. The learner sees enrichments in the
"Additional Context" section of the lesson overview dialog (alongside exemplar
and objectives), where they can reference it throughout the lesson.

### Lifecycle

1. **Lesson start** — `client/src/lib/lessonEngine.js#startLesson()` calls
   `POST /v1/sync/lesson-started` (server route in `sync.js`)
2. **Hook emit** — server emits `lessonStarted` with `{ userId, lessonId, lesson: { name, markdown, exemplar, learningObjectives }, lessonKB }`
3. **Plugin handlers** — each plugin with `hook.lessonStarted` + `lessonEnrichment`
   capability runs; non-null return values are collected
4. **Return to client** — `{ enrichments: [...] }` returned to `startLesson()`
5. **Storage** — if enrichments exist, stored on `lessonKB.enrichments` and synced
6. **Coach context** — `buildContext()` injects enrichments into coach system prompt
   as `enrichmentContext: [{ source, context, reasoning }]`
7. **UI display** — `LessonChat` displays enrichments in the "Additional Context"
   section of the lesson overview dialog (opened via "Lesson Overview" button)
8. **Resume** — enrichments are read from cached `lessonKB` (never re-computed)

### Enrichment data contract

A plugin's `lessonStarted` hook handler returns:

```js
{
  pluginId: 'wordpress-info',       // Required: plugin id
  label: 'WordPress.org',            // Required: display name
  context: 'When building...',       // Required: ~300 word summary
  reasoning: 'This lesson focuses...', // Required: why this matters
  sources: [                         // Optional: citation links
    { url: 'https://...', title: '...', excerpt: '...' }
  ]
}
```

Return `null` (or omit return) when the plugin doesn't enrich this lesson. The
host filters out nulls — only non-null returns are stored.

### UI components

- **LessonLoadingView** (`client/src/components/chat/LessonLoadingView.jsx`) —
  stepped progress UI showing: (1) Initializing lesson (Lesson Owner), (2) Enriching
  lesson (plugins — only shown when active), (3) Starting conversation (Coach).
  The enrichment step expands to show per-plugin progress when multiple plugins
  are active. Includes `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` for screen reader
  announcements.
- **Lesson Overview Dialog** (`client/src/pages/LessonChat.jsx`) — modal dialog
  displaying lesson name, description, exemplar, learning objectives, and an
  "Additional Context" section showing enrichment data from plugins. Each enrichment
  is a semantic `<section>` with heading (`<h4>`), reasoning text, context paragraph,
  and source links in a `<nav>` with proper aria-labels and focus styles. The dialog
  content is scrollable (`max-h-[85vh]`) to handle long enrichments.

### WordPress Info plugin (reference implementation)

Three-agent pipeline (`plugins/wordpress-info/`):

1. **Planner** (`prompts/wordpress-info-planner.md`) — detects WordPress keywords
   in lesson objectives, outputs `{ shouldEnrich: bool, queries: [{ text, sources }] }`
2. **Query executor** (`server/query-executor.js`) — fetches from wordpress.org
   REST API, Make WordPress blogs, GitHub code search in parallel (8s timeout per
   source, fail-open on errors)
3. **Synthesizer** (`prompts/wordpress-info-synthesizer.md`) — distills query
   results into lesson-specific ~300 word summary: relevant APIs, best practices,
   common pitfalls

Hook handler (`server/index.js`) orchestrates the pipeline, returns enrichment
data or `null`. SSRF defense: all fetched URLs validated against `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
(`developer.wordpress.org`, `make.wordpress.org`, `api.github.com`).

### Design invariants

- **Fail-open, always.** Enrichment errors (planner fails, executor times out,
  synthesizer throws) must never block lesson start. Plugin handlers return `null`,
  the lesson proceeds normally.
- **Coach-owned completion.** Enrichment provides reference material the coach can
  draw on, but MUST NOT override completion semantics. `applyCoachResponseToKB`
  remains the single owner of `progress` and the exemplar. The enrichment context
  is framed as informational background, never as requirements.
- **One-shot computation.** Enrichment runs once at start, cached on `lessonKB`.
  Never re-runs on resume (learner sees same artifacts every time), never re-runs
  per chat turn (that would be the chat-context contributor pattern, not enrichment).
- **Timing budget.** Enrichment should complete in ~3-5 seconds to keep lesson
  start snappy. Plugins with slow sources should use timeouts, caching, or
  background jobs. The UI progress indicator keeps the learner informed.
- **Synthesis, not inlining.** Don't inline full documentation pages into the coach
  context — the synthesizer should distill to ~300 words of lesson-specific info.
  Sources are cited via links in the artifact panel.

### Why at start, not per-turn?

Enrichment is a **lesson-level** concern: "what background does the coach need
for *this lesson*?" Chat-context contributors (link attachments, image analysis)
are **turn-level**: "what context does the coach need for *this message*?"

Start-time enrichment:
- **Pro:** computed once, cached; no per-turn latency; learner sees what the coach
  has in mind from the beginning
- **Con:** can't adapt to learner questions mid-lesson (but the coach can still
  reference enrichment context when relevant)

Per-turn enrichment would:
- Add 1-3s latency to every coach reply (unacceptable for microlearning pacing)
- Bloat every turn's context with retrieval results (coach context is already dense)
- Force learners to wait through "Searching docs…" spinners repeatedly

The trade-off: enrichment is less dynamic but preserves the lesson's 20-minute
pacing target. If a learner asks a question the enrichment doesn't cover, the
coach still has the full lesson context + link attachments to draw on.

### Extension point for other plugins

Any plugin with `lessonEnrichment` capability + `lessonStarted` hook can provide
enrichment. Examples:
- **React Docs** — detect React keywords, fetch from react.dev
- **Internal KB** — query Confluence/Notion when lesson mentions company concepts
- **Recent updates** — pull latest bug reports, release notes, deprecations
- **Security policies** — inject org-specific code standards, compliance notes

The pattern is the same: detect relevance → fetch sources → synthesize summary →
return enrichment object or `null`.

### Known gaps & future work

- **Phase 1 agent calling** — plugins currently import `orchestrator.js` and call
  `converseStream` directly; Phase 3's `agent` capability will formalize prompt
  upsertion to sync-data and agent invocation via SDK
- **Structured output** — agents are instructed to return JSON, parsing happens in
  the hook handler; native structured-output tool would be cleaner
- **Hook return-value collection** — the hook system was extended to collect
  non-null returns; this pattern could extend to other hooks (e.g., `lessonCompleted`
  for summary generation)
- **Multi-lesson caching** — WordPress Info queries the same sources for every
  WordPress lesson; a shared cache (Redis or sync-data) could dedupe across lessons

## Lessons: visibility, drafts, courses, classroom

### Visibility

Lessons have three statuses:

- `public` — visible to all (legacy `published` normalizes to `public`).
- `private` — visible only to users in `sharedWith`.
- `draft` — in-progress, admin-only, no markdown yet.

A record is a **true draft** iff `status === 'draft'` AND markdown is empty;
legacy `status: 'draft'` records that *do* have markdown are treated as
`private` to preserve pre-rework semantics. Drafts surface as a `Draft` pill in
Admin → Lessons and are never exposed to learner-facing endpoints.

New lessons start as `draft` the moment the Lesson Creator conversation begins
(one `lesson:<id>` record per draft in `_system` sync-data), so admins can pause
and resume drafts or work on several in parallel. Clicking "Create Lesson"
finalizes the same record with extracted markdown and flips status
`draft` → `private` (shared only with author). Admins toggle public/private on
finalized lessons and manage shared users via the Share modal. Drafts hide the
Share icon (nothing shareable yet).

### Courses

Optional taxonomy for grouping lessons. Each course is a first-class
`_system:course:<id>` sync-data record with `{ name }`. Each lesson carries an
optional `course` field (course ID, like `userGroup` on users). Pure
organization — courses don't carry visibility/ACL; lesson visibility is
unchanged. The learner-facing `GET /v1/lessons` and `/v1/lessons/:id` inline
`course: { id, name } | null` so the coach context (`buildContext` in
`client/src/lib/lessonEngine.js`) can include `course: { name }` when assigned.
Admin manages courses via a "Courses" button on Admin → Lessons (mirrors the
User Groups pattern); the lesson editor has a course dropdown that persists
immediately on edit; the lessons table has a Course column. Course delete
cascades: any lesson whose `course` referenced the deleted course is rewritten
with `course: null`.

### Learner classroom

`/lessons` (`client/src/pages/LessonsList.jsx`): lessons render as a responsive
grid (1 col mobile / 2 col `sm:` / 3 col `lg:`) with 12 per page. A course
filter dropdown sits above the grid; it's hidden when no courses exist. When the
filter is set to a course that no longer exists, it snaps back to "All courses"
automatically. Filter and page changes are announced via an always-mounted
`role="status" aria-live="polite"` region — no visible "N lessons" subhead.

`loadLessons()` merges system lessons (`/v1/lessons`) with user lessons from
sync-data. To preview a lesson as a learner sees it (the live coach experience),
admins share the lesson with themselves and view it in the classroom — the
editor preview only renders the lesson markdown.

### Lesson editor

Editing is conversation-based via the Lesson Creator agent (no raw markdown
editor). The editor is deep-linked at `/plato/lessons/:lessonId/edit` (mirrors
the `users/:userId` pattern) so it survives reload and browser-back.
`/plato/lessons/new` mints a fresh `admin-<ms>` draft id and `replace`-redirects
to that edit URL — the draft record is created lazily by the editor's first
auto-save. The edit route fetches the lesson on mount; a missing/deleted lesson
redirects to `/plato/lessons`, but a 404 on a freshly-minted draft id (within
`FRESH_DRAFT_WINDOW_MS`, i.e. not yet auto-saved) opens create mode instead of
bouncing. `AdminLessons` keys `NewLessonView` on `lessonId` so switching lessons
remounts cleanly.

**Markdown preview pane** (`client/src/pages/admin/MarkdownPreviewPane.jsx`):
chat left, rendered markdown right, stacking below `lg`. The preview is
**manually refreshed** via a "Generate preview" / "Refresh preview" button that
re-runs the relevant extractor agent — it does NOT auto-update per message and
runs no AI call on editor open. On open the pane shows the already-saved markdown
(edit) or a quiet empty-state (new). Once the conversation advances past the last
refresh a "Preview may be outdated" hint appears. The preview is **not
persisted** — a standing note tells the admin to click the save button.
`buildConversationText` (`client/src/lib/lessonCreationEngine.js`) is the shared
builder for the extractor input, used by both the finalize and preview-refresh
paths. The same pane (copy parametrized via props) backs both the lesson editor
(`extractLessonMarkdown`) and the **knowledge base editor**
(`AdminCustomizer` + `AdminKBSetup`, `extractKBMarkdown`).

### Coach directive

A lesson can carry **author-supplied runtime instructions for the coach** that
are neither exemplar nor objective — e.g. "reference the learner's portfolio
project throughout (don't ask what it is)," "if the learner picks tool X, share
this discount code + URL with these checkout caveats," or "assume the learner
already finished the intro lesson." These flow end-to-end through one optional
`## Coach Directive` markdown section:

1. **Extract** — `lesson-extractor` emits `## Coach Directive` **verbatim**
   (codes, URLs, caveats intact) only when the conversation contained such
   instructions; otherwise it omits the heading.
2. **Parse** — `parseLessonPrompt` (`client/js/lessonOwner.js`) reads the
   section into `lesson.coachDirective` (buffered like the exemplar so multi-line
   directives survive; absent ⇒ no key).
3. **Serve** — `buildContext` (`client/src/lib/lessonEngine.js`) surfaces it as
   `context.coachDirective` in **both** active and completed states.
4. **Obey** — `coach.md` treats it as a high-priority instruction followed every
   exchange. It refines *how* the coach runs the lesson; it never overrides the
   exemplar, assessment, or completion semantics (the coach still owns
   `progress`). The Lesson Creator (`lesson-creator.md`) is aware of directives
   and confirms them back to the admin rather than silently dropping them.

Historically this was a gap: the extractor's output format had no slot for
coach-facing instructions, so anything an admin typed beyond exemplar/objectives
(the Creator would echo it conversationally) was summarized away and never
reached the coach. Adding the field at all four layers closed the loop.

**Extraction contract — keep these in lockstep.** What an admin discusses in the
Lesson Creator conversation only persists if the Lesson Extractor has a field
for it. The set of persisted fields (name, description, exemplar, 2-4
objectives, optional coach directive) is the contract, and it's enforced by
prose in **five** places that must change together when a field is added or
removed: `lesson-extractor.md` (output format), `parseLessonPrompt`
(`client/js/lessonOwner.js`), `buildContext` (`client/src/lib/lessonEngine.js`),
`coach.md` (so the coach reads it), and — critically — `lesson-creator.md`'s
"What the lesson actually saves" section, so the Creator agent never promises an
admin something the extractor will silently drop. Adding a persisted lesson
field without updating the Creator's contract reintroduces exactly the
scrubbed-directive bug.

### Course progress (cross-lesson memory)

When a lesson belongs to a course, the coach gets a **tiny, distilled,
per-learner note of what that learner has demonstrated in the course's *other*
lessons**, so it can connect threads ("building on the prompt you wrote earlier
in the course…"). This is the learner-profile pattern scoped to a course — same
proven, bounded plumbing as `profileSummary`, not a new mechanism.

- **Store** — one `courseProgress:<courseId>` per learner (sync-data, key
  allowlisted in `server/src/routes/sync.js`):
  `{ courseId, summary, completedLessonIds[], updatedAt }`.
- **Regenerate** — on completion, the `if (achieved)` block in
  `lessonEngine.js` calls `updateCourseProgressOnCompletionInBackground`
  (`client/src/lib/courseProgressQueue.js`, a sequential queue mirroring
  `profileQueue.js`) **only when the lesson has a course**. The new
  `course-progress-update` agent (`client/prompts/course-progress-update.md`,
  `orchestrator.updateCourseProgress`) receives the *prior* summary + the *one*
  just-completed lesson's KB (+ the course's lesson list from
  `getLessonsInCourse`) and returns an updated summary with a **hard ~600-char
  cap**. This **incremental distillation** — never concatenating all sibling KBs
  — is what keeps both the agent's input and the injected note small.
- **Inject** — `buildContext` takes an optional 5th `courseProgress` arg and, when
  present, attaches it as `context.course.progress`. `startLesson`/`sendMessage`
  fetch it via `loadCourseProgressSummary` when the lesson opens (within a session
  the value only changes via *other* lessons' completions, so fetch-on-open is
  enough). `coach.md` documents `course: { name, progress? }` as informational —
  it never touches the exemplar or completion (`applyCoachResponseToKB` stays the
  single owner of `progress`).

**Out-of-order completion just works**: complete B → `courseProgress:<id>`
regenerates → resume A → A's coach reads the now-current note including B. No
coupling between the lessons themselves.

*Known limitation (v1):* summaries build **forward** from completions after this
shipped; pre-existing completions are not backfilled.

## Pacing & completion philosophy

Microlearning constraints live in `client/src/lib/constants.js`:
`MAX_EXCHANGES=11`, `MIN_OBJECTIVES=2`, `MAX_OBJECTIVES=4`,
`MINS_PER_EXCHANGE=1.8`. Server mirrors them in
`server/src/lib/lesson-limits.js`. Prompts reference these as literal numbers
(update both if changed).

Lessons target 11 exchanges (~20 min). **There is no hard cutoff** — lessons
always run until the coach awards progress 10. The coach gets escalating
`pacingDirective` nudges in the context JSON (at 8+, 11+, 15+, 20+) but these
are suggestions, never orders. `client/src/lib/lessonEngine.js` must **never**
auto-complete a lesson based on exchange count; only `parsed.progress >= 10`
triggers completion. Philosophy: "move people, not force people" — the coach can
always introduce new scaffolding if the learner needs it. `extendedLessons`
(completions at 22+ exchanges) is informational only — it signals lesson-design
mismatch, not a metric to drive to zero.

### Post-completion feedback mode

Once `lessonKB.status === 'completed'`, the thread is feedback-only.

- `activitiesCompleted` freezes (it's the learning-exchange counter, not a
  total-turn counter — post-completion chatter doesn't count and would corrupt
  the `extendedLessons` KPI if it did).
- `pacingDirective` is suppressed and `postCompletionDirective` replaces it,
  telling the coach never to coach, assess, or award progress for a *different*
  lesson inside the same thread.
- `achieved` is one-shot — only true on the transition turn — so completion side
  effects (confetti, completion profile update) don't re-fire on subsequent
  feedback messages.

The pure helper `applyCoachResponseToKB` in `lessonEngine.js` is the **single
owner** of this invariant.

## Denormalization policy

plato's source of truth for learner activity is the `sync-data` table
(`lessonKB:*`, `messages:*`, etc.). When a read path requires aggregating across
many of those records — counts, "last X" timestamps, percentages — the right
move is to denormalize a derived field onto a record that's already cheap to
fetch (typically the user record), maintained by hooks on the sync write path.
The Admin → Users `lessonsCompleted` + `lastActiveAt` fields (#136) are the
canonical example. Do this **responsibly**:

- **Single writer.** Exactly one code path mutates each denormalized field —
  `server/src/routes/sync.js`'s `applyActivityEffects` for activity counters. No
  other route writes these fields directly. This is the only way to keep "two
  places" from drifting.
- **Transition detection for status counters.** The coach writes a `lessonKB`
  multiple times after completion (post-completion feedback turns keep updating
  it). Counters that fire on status flips must read the prior record and only
  increment on the first transition (non-completed → completed). Repeat writes
  with the same status MUST NOT double-count. `lessonsCompleted` has a dedicated
  test for this; new counters must too.
- **Published-only stats.** Every dashboard/per-user KPI counts **only published
  (public) lessons** — drafts, privates (even when shared to a learner via
  `sharedWith`), and user-created custom lessons are excluded from both the
  numerator and the denominator. The rule lives in
  `server/src/lib/lesson-visibility.js` (`normalizeStatus`, `publicLessonIds`,
  `isPublicLessonRecord`); a completion counts iff its lesson id maps to a public
  `_system:lesson:*` record. Custom lessons (stored under the learner's own
  `lessons:custom-*` sync-data, never in `_system`) fall out for free. The
  `applyActivityEffects` writer looks up the lesson record before incrementing.
- **Best-effort writes, never blocking.** The primary sync write succeeds first.
  The counter update is wrapped in try/catch and logged but never thrown. If it
  fails, the user's lesson data is still correct — only the counter is stale, and
  lazy-backfill heals it on next admin read.
- **Lazy backfill instead of migrations.** When the read endpoint encounters a
  record with an undefined counter (legacy user), it computes the value once and
  persists it back. After that, reads are O(1). No deploy-time migration step.
- **Source of truth is still the underlying data.** Counters are an index, not
  authoritative. On drift, the underlying sync-data wins; a manual rebuild script
  can re-derive counters from scratch.
- **Anti-goals.** Don't denormalize fields that change on every learner message
  (write amplification — message-rate is plato's hot path). Don't make the
  primary write fail if the denormalized write fails. Don't add a second write
  path for the same field. Don't denormalize values that depend on cross-user
  state (e.g. a user's "rank in the classroom") — compute those per-request from
  cheap classroom-wide lists.

### Per-user activity stats (#136)

Admins see a learner's lesson activity on the Admin → Users edit-user view,
deep-linked at `/plato/users/:userId` so refresh and browser-back preserve the
selection. The edit-user state is derived from the URL via `useParams`;
`openEditUser` navigates rather than setting state directly. A bad userId
silently redirects back to `/plato/users`.

`UserStatsPanel` (`client/src/pages/admin/UserStatsPanel.jsx`) fetches
`GET /v1/admin/users/:userId/stats` and renders three summary tiles (a
CompletionRing for completed/available with color thresholds at 35%/90%,
logins-in-window count, median completion time with p90 sub) and a list of
completed lessons. Computed on demand — no precomputation.

- UI uses "completed" / "completion time" rather than "mastered" / "time to
  mastery" because the underlying field is `lessonKB.status === 'completed'` —
  calling it mastery would imply a quality claim we don't measure.
- Duration is exchange-based (`activitiesCompleted × MINS_PER_EXCHANGE`) for
  consistency with `/v1/admin/stats/lessons` — wall-clock minutes inflate from
  multi-session lessons.
- Logins come from audit-log `user_login` entries (written by `/v1/auth/login`;
  the audit-log table has no GSI on userId, so reads use Scan-with-filter — fine
  at current scale, revisit at ~100k entries).

The Admin → Users table opt-in `?include=stats` adds `lessonsCompleted`,
`lessonsAvailable`, and `lastActiveAt` to each row; the Completed column renders
a compact CompletionRing colored by progress.

- `lessonsCompleted` (published-only) is **recomputed per request** from the
  learner's sync-data against the live public-lesson set, and the denormalized
  counter is healed (overwritten) when it drifts. The `applyActivityEffects`
  hook keeps the stored counter close in the meantime, but it can't be trusted
  on its own for visibility — a lesson can go public→private *after* a learner
  completes it, and legacy/pre-filter counters may be inflated. Recomputing on
  read is the deliberate trade (chosen over a one-time migration): it loosens
  the strict O(1)-per-user goal for a small per-user read, which self-corrects
  prod's existing counters. To keep that cheap at hundreds of users, the read
  uses `db.getSyncDataByPrefix(userId, 'lessonKB:')` — a **sort-key prefix
  query** that returns only the `lessonKB:*` records (tens of tiny items),
  never the large `screenshot:*`/`messages:*` payloads. `getAllSyncData`
  (full-partition, unprojected) must NOT be used in per-user loops over the
  whole classroom for this reason.
- `lastActiveAt` is **not** updated on `messages:*` writes (write amplification —
  see anti-goals); instead it's updated on `/v1/auth/login` and `/v1/auth/refresh`,
  giving a natural ~15-min heartbeat (access-token TTL). It stays a true
  denormalized read (lazily backfilled, not recomputed).
- All activity writes are best-effort (try/catch, swallowed). The lessonKB
  pre-read (used to detect the transition) and the `_system:lesson:*` visibility
  lookup are wrapped in try/catch — a failure just defaults to no increment, and
  the next stats read heals it; the lesson write never fails.
- `lessonsAvailable` is the count of **public** lessons (`publicLessonIds(...)`),
  computed per-request from the small classroom-wide lesson list — the same
  denominator for every learner.
- Columns are sortable (click header to cycle asc/desc with aria-sort + a polite
  live region); nullish values always sort last regardless of direction so
  invites cluster predictably. Modals/dropdowns that don't need stats call the
  base endpoint to skip the lessons-available computation.

`CompletionRing` (`client/src/pages/admin/CompletionRing.jsx`) is an SVG donut
showing completed / available lessons, color-coded (red <35%, yellow 35–89%,
green ≥90%).

### Admin dashboard KPIs

Admin dashboard at `/plato` (lazy-loaded, role-gated) has two KPI sections:

- **Learner Engagement** — `Started lessons %` (target ≥90%) and
  `Completed 50%+ of lessons %` (target >50%). Denominator is non-admin users;
  "started" = ≥1 `lessonKB:*` record for a **public** lesson (any status);
  "completed 50%+" = `lessonsCompleted / lessonsAvailable > 0.5` (strict — exactly
  50% does not count), where both sides are published-only. Each widget renders
  green on target, red below.
- **Lesson Pacing** — on-target rate, over-target count, extended-lesson count.

Both are powered by `GET /v1/admin/stats/lessons`, which is **stale-while-
revalidate cached** in `_system:stats:lessons` sync-data (see
`server/src/lib/lesson-stats-cache.js`). Fresh window: 10 min. Stale window
(10 min–24 h): cached payload served and an async Lambda self-invoke kicks off a
refresh (`InvocationType: 'Event'`, see the wrapped handler in
`server/src/index.js`). Expired (>24 h) or missing: recompute synchronously. The
recompute walks every user's `lessonKB:*` + `messages:*` records (via
`getSyncDataByPrefix`, skipping the large `screenshot:*` payloads), so it should
never be on the hot path of an admin page load. `lambda:InvokeFunction`
scoped to `${StackName}-*` is granted to `PlatoApiFunction` in `template.yaml`.
In local dev / tests, `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME` is unset and the kickoff is a
no-op.

## Admin "View as User"

Admins can audit a learner's classroom (lesson list, conversation history,
lesson KB) without asking for screenshots. Triggered from a "View as user"
button in the purple admin bar in the classroom (`AppShell`); a yellow status
strip with an "Exit" button surfaces underneath while impersonation is active.

- Read-only `?asUserId=<id>` query param threaded onto GET `/v1/sync*` and GET
  `/v1/lessons*` from `client/js/auth.js`'s `authenticatedFetch`; admin-gated
  server-side.
- **Writes never carry the param** — server returns 403 on PUT/DELETE with
  `?asUserId=` (defense-in-depth), and `client/src/lib/lessonEngine.js`'s
  `startLesson`/`sendMessage` throw at the top to belt-and-suspenders the
  disabled `ComposeBar`.
- Impersonation state lives in `sessionStorage('plato_impersonation')` (per-tab)
  and `AuthContext`. `startImpersonation` / `stopImpersonation` clear the storage
  cache *and* hard-reload to `/lessons` — clearing the cache alone wasn't enough
  because `AppContext` (lesson list, per-lesson progress badges) holds component
  state that wouldn't otherwise re-fetch. For an audit feature, "no stale data"
  beats a faster transition.
- Audit-logged at session granularity (`admin_view_as_user_started` / `_ended`)
  — per-read entries would spam the log. POST `/v1/admin/impersonation/start`
  `{ targetUserId }` writes the start entry and returns the target profile for
  the banner; POST `/v1/admin/impersonation/end` is best-effort (no-op if the
  admin closes the tab — the start entry is the source of truth).
