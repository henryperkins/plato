# Extension reference

Flat reference of every plato extension point. One section per surface; no nesting beyond H2 so AI agents can grep and find a single match.

## Slots

### `adminSettingsPanel`

- **Capability:** `ui.slot.adminSettingsPanel`
- **Renders inside:** `client/src/pages/admin/AdminPlugins.jsx` (the plugin card)
- **Props:** `{ pluginId: string, settings: object, onSave: (next) => Promise<void> }`
- **When:** the admin expands "Show settings" on the plugin's card
- **Phase:** 1
- **Example:** `plugins/slack/client/SlackSettingsPanel.jsx`
- **Gotchas:** if you don't ship a custom panel, plato auto-renders a form from `manifest.settingsSchema`. Pick one; don't ship both.

### `adminUserRowAction`

- **Capability:** `ui.slot.adminUserRowAction`
- **Renders inside:** `client/src/pages/admin/AdminUsers.jsx` — actions cell at the right end of each user row, before the Delete button
- **Props:** `{ user: AdminUser }` (see SDK `AdminUser` type)
- **Phase:** 1
- **Example:** `plugins/teacher-comments/client/UserRowAction.jsx`
- **Gotchas:** the host wraps the slot in a `stopPropagation` container so clicks inside the slot don't trigger the row's edit-user navigation. Plugin components don't need their own `stopPropagation`. The slot only renders for confirmed users — invite rows skip the slot.

### `adminHomeKpi`

- **Capability:** `ui.slot.adminHomeKpi`
- **Renders inside:** `client/src/pages/admin/AdminHome.jsx` after `<PacingSection>`
- **Props:** `{}` (KPIs fetch their own data via `/v1/admin/stats/plugins`)
- **Phase:** 2 (declared, not yet rendered)

### `adminProfileFields`

- **Capability:** `ui.slot.adminProfileFields`
- **Renders inside:** `client/src/pages/admin/AdminUsers.jsx` — below the form fields on the Edit User page
- **Props:** `{ user: AdminUser }`
- **Phase:** 1.1
- **Example:** `plugins/teacher-comments/client/ProfileField.jsx` (admin comment thread)
- **Gotchas:** the slot mounts inside the same Card as the form fields. Plugin components should structure their own visual separator (e.g., `<Separator />` + section heading) so they don't blend into the form. Multiple plugins contributing to this slot stack vertically in registration order.

### `learnerProfileFields`

- **Capability:** `ui.slot.learnerProfileFields`
- **Renders inside:** `client/src/pages/Settings.jsx` below the Learner Profile card
- **Props:** `{ profile: LearnerProfile }`
- **Phase:** 1.3

### `learnerHomeBanner`

- **Capability:** `ui.slot.learnerHomeBanner`
- **Renders inside:** `client/src/pages/LessonsList.jsx` below the Lessons heading
- **Props:** `{}`
- **Phase:** 1.3

### `learnerCompletionAfter`

- **Capability:** `ui.slot.learnerCompletionAfter`
- **Renders inside:** `client/src/pages/LessonChat.jsx` after the chat log when `lessonKB.status === 'completed'`
- **Props:** `{ lessonId: string, lessonKB: object }`
- **Phase:** 1.3
- **Gotchas:** presentation-only. The slot renders only after the host's lesson engine has already marked the lesson completed; plugins must not trigger completion, alter pacing, or award progress.

## Lifecycle methods

Optional functions a plugin's `server/index.js` default export can declare.
Distinct from event hooks below — these are one-shot host-invoked methods,
not pub-sub events.

### `onActivate(ctx)`

Runs once when admin enables the plugin AND once at boot if the plugin is
already enabled. Idempotent. Use for migrations, cache warmup, seeding. Don't
run heavy work here — it's synchronous in the boot path.

Errors are caught and logged as `plugin_on_activate_failed`; the plugin
continues to run.

### `onDeactivate(ctx)`

Runs when admin disables the plugin. Should release resources, NOT delete
user data. Settings are preserved across disable/enable cycles.

Errors are caught and logged as `plugin_on_deactivate_failed`.

### `onUninstall(ctx)`

Optional. Runs only when an admin uses the "Delete plugin data" flow on
`/plato/plugins`.

- Plugin must be **disabled** first (host refuses otherwise).
- Admin must type the plugin id in a confirm dialog.
- The host clears the plugin's settings/activation entry after `onUninstall`
  completes successfully — every plugin gets that for free.

**Implement `onUninstall` only if your plugin owns data beyond the
activation record** — for example, per-user `userMeta:<id>` records or
`plugin:<id>:*` sync-data namespace records (Phase 3+). For a plugin whose
only state is its settings (e.g. Slack's bot token), no `onUninstall` is
needed; the host's activation-record cleanup is sufficient.

For a plugin that uses `userMeta:<id>`, the cleanup iterates users and
calls `deleteUserMeta`:

```js
async onUninstall(ctx) {
  const users = await db.listAllUsers();
  for (const u of users) {
    if (await getUserMeta(u.userId, ctx.pluginId)) {
      await deleteUserMeta(u.userId, ctx.pluginId);
    }
  }
}
```

**Errors propagate** — unlike `onActivate`/`onDeactivate`, partial-cleanup
failures are surfaced to the admin so they can retry rather than silently
leaving data behind.

The audit log gets a `plugin_data_uninstalled` entry with the admin's user
id and the plugin id.

Available since Plugin API 1.2.0.

## Hooks

The hook bus is at `server/src/lib/plugins/hooks.js`. **Open by design** — any event name works. Plugins MAY emit/subscribe to arbitrary names following the convention `<plugin-id>.<event>`. Core emits a known subset (this list).

### `userCreated`

- **Capability:** `hook.userCreated`
- **Payload:** `{ userId: string, email: string, role: 'admin' | 'user' }`
- **Emit point:** `server/src/routes/auth.js` after `db.createUser` — both the bootstrap-admin path (`POST /v1/auth/bootstrap-admin`) and the invite-accept signup path (`POST /v1/auth/signup`)
- **Fires:** AFTER the user record is persisted. Observe-only; handlers can't abort. Errors in handlers are logged but don't fail the user-facing request.
- **Phase:** 1.1
- **Notes:** Bootstrap admins created at server-startup via env-vars (in `server/src/index.js` and `dev-sqlite.js`) bypass this emit point — the hook bus may not be initialized yet at that boot phase. If you need to react to ALL users including the very first admin, run a sweep on plugin activate.

### `userUpdated`

- **Capability:** `hook.userUpdated`
- **Payload:** `{ userId: string, updates: object }`
- **Emit point:** `server/src/routes/me.js` PATCH `/v1/me`; `server/src/routes/admin.js` PATCH `/v1/admin/users/:id`
- **Phase:** 2 (capability and bus exist; emit-point not yet wired)

### `profileUpdated`

- **Capability:** `hook.profileUpdated`
- **Payload:** `{ userId: string, key: 'profile' | 'profileSummary', data: object }`
- **Emit point:** `server/src/routes/sync.js` after PUT of `profile`/`profileSummary`
- **Phase:** 2

### `lessonStarted`

- **Capability:** `hook.lessonStarted`
- **Payload:** `{ userId: string, lessonId: string, lessonKB: object }`
- **Emit point:** `server/src/routes/sync.js` on first PUT of `lessonKB:<id>` (no prior version)
- **Phase:** 2

### `lessonCompleted`

- **Capability:** `hook.lessonCompleted`
- **Payload:** `{ userId: string, lessonId: string, lessonKB: object }`
- **Emit point:** `server/src/routes/sync.js` on PUT of `lessonKB:<id>` when status flips to `'completed'`
- **Phase:** 2
- **Gotchas:** OBSERVE-ONLY. Hooks fire AFTER the lessonKB is persisted. Plugins MUST NOT participate in the completion decision (that's the coach's job, single-owned by `applyCoachResponseToKB`).

### `coachExchangeRecorded`

- **Capability:** `hook.coachExchangeRecorded`
- **Payload:** `{ userId: string, lessonId: string, messageCount: number }`
- **Phase:** 3

### `userDeleted`

- **Capability:** `hook.userDeleted`
- **Payload:** `{ userId: string, email: string, role: 'admin' | 'user' }`
- **Emit point:** `server/src/routes/me.js` DELETE `/v1/me`; `server/src/routes/admin.js` DELETE `/v1/admin/users/:id`
- **Fires:** BEFORE the cascade. Plugins can read their own `userMeta:<id>` records before they're deleted by the cascade. The host awaits all handlers before proceeding to delete the user's sync-data and user record.
- **Phase:** 1.1
- **Notes:** The user's `userMeta:*` records are auto-deleted by the cascade — plugins don't need to explicitly clean up. Subscribe to this hook only if you have side effects beyond plato (e.g., notify external systems, archive content).

## Secret events

Targeted secret events are in-process plugin-to-plugin calls for sensitive payloads. They are not the open hook bus.

### `extensionPoints.secretEvents`

- **Capability:** `secretEvent.receive.<plugin-id>.<event>`
- **Manifest shape:** `{ "secretEvents": [{ "event": "openrouter-rewards.keyAwarded" }] }`
- **Server export shape:** `export default { secretEvents: { async 'openrouter-rewards.keyAwarded'(payload, ctx) { ... } } }`
- **Emit API:** `ctx.emitSecretTo('slack', 'openrouter-rewards.keyAwarded', payload)` or SDK `emitSecret(event, targetPluginId, payload)`
- **Phase:** 1.3
- **Gotchas:** only the target plugin id receives the payload, and only while that plugin is enabled. Handler errors are logged as `plugin_secret_event_failed` and do not prevent delivery to other handlers for the same target.

## Capabilities

| Capability | Grants | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| `server.routes` | Mount Hono router under `/v1/plugins/<id>/` | 1 |
| `settings.read` | Read the plugin's own settings record | 1 |
| `settings.write` | Write the plugin's own settings record | 1 |
| `ui.slot.<SlotName>` | Register a component for slot `<SlotName>` | 1+ |
| `ui.adminNav` | Add an admin sidebar link | 2 |
| `hook.<HookName>` | Subscribe to lifecycle hook `<HookName>` | 2+ |
| `secretEvent.receive.<plugin-id>.<event>` | Receive targeted secret event `<plugin-id>.<event>` | 1.3 |
| `user.metadata.read` | Read `userMeta:<pluginId>` per user | 2 |
| `user.metadata.write` | Write `userMeta:<pluginId>` per user | 2 |
| `kpi` | Contribute admin KPIs | 2 |
| `agent` | Contribute AI agent prompt | 3 |
| `syncData.namespace` | Write `plugin:<id>:*` sync-data keys | 3 |

A plugin using an extension point without declaring its capability fails registration with `plugin_capability_missing`.

## Server SDK exports (`src/lib/plugins/sdk.js`)

| Export | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Hono` | Create routers for `routes` |
| `db` | Database access (read/write sync-data, users) |

**Per-user storage convention:** `userMeta:<pluginId>` is the canonical key
shape. Each plugin gets one record per user.

**Learner isolation** — `userMeta:*` records are admin-owned. Every learner-
facing path that touches the user's own sync-data excludes them:

  - `GET /v1/sync` (bulk) — filtered out of the listing
  - `GET /v1/sync/:dataKey` (single) — rejected by the key whitelist regex
  - `PUT /v1/sync/:dataKey` — rejected by the key whitelist regex
  - `DELETE /v1/sync/:dataKey` (single) — rejected by the key whitelist regex
  - `DELETE /v1/sync` (bulk reset of own data) — `userMeta:*` preserved
  - `GET /v1/me/export` (download my data) — `userMeta:*` filtered out

The only paths that delete `userMeta:*` are account-deletion (DELETE /v1/me
self-delete; DELETE /v1/admin/users/:id admin-delete) and a plugin's own
`onUninstall` hook. Both account-deletion paths fire `userDeleted` BEFORE
the cascade so plugins can read their data on the way out if needed.

Plugins that want learner-visible per-user data should expose their own
routes.

Adding to this surface is a core change — it widens the public plugin contract.

## Client primitives plugins can import

- `react` (aliased in `client/vite.config.js` to `client/node_modules/react`)
- `@/components/ui/*` — shadcn-style UI primitives (Button, Input, Label, Card, etc.)
- `@/lib/*` — shared client utilities (branding, helpers)
- Relative paths into `client/js/*` (`auth.js` etc.)

## Endpoints

### `GET /v1/admin/plugins`

Admin only. Returns every plugin (enabled, disabled, load-failed) with manifest + settings.

### `PUT /v1/admin/plugins/:id/activation`

Admin only. Body: `{ enabled: boolean }`. Toggles activation. Runs `onActivate`/`onDeactivate`.

### `PUT /v1/admin/plugins/:id/settings`

Admin only. Body: arbitrary settings object. Persists to `_system:plugins:activation.<id>.settings`. Omitted `writeOnly` settings are preserved from the existing settings record; explicitly sent values replace or clear them.

### `GET /v1/plugins`

Authenticated. Returns enabled plugins with sanitized settings (writeOnly fields stripped). Used by the client loader.

### `GET /v1/plugins/extension-points`

Authenticated. Machine-readable inventory of slots, hooks, capabilities, and the host API version. Use this from AI agents to discover what's possible.

### `/v1/plugins/<id>/...`

Plugin-mounted routes. 404 when the plugin is disabled. Auth/authz applied by the plugin's own middleware.
