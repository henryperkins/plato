# Contributing to plato

Thank you for your interest in contributing to plato. This project is maintained by [11:11 Philosopher's Group](https://github.com/1111philo).

## The fastest way to contribute: file an issue

plato runs an automated pilot agent (`plato-pilot`) on a daily schedule. It reads open `ready-for-pilot` issues, picks one, and opens a focused PR that addresses it. **Most contributions to plato start as a clear issue, not a PR.** That includes bug reports, copy changes, small feature requests, and accessibility fixes.

When you open an issue:

1. The intake agent (`.github/workflows/issue-intake.yml`) reads it and labels it `ready-for-pilot` (enough detail to act on), `needs-info` (asks up to 3 clarifying questions), or closes it as off-topic with an explanation.
2. If labeled `ready-for-pilot`, the next pilot run picks it up. plato-pilot follows a strict picking order: **community-authored issues first** (anyone who isn't the bot itself), then self-filed maintenance tickets, then KPI/log signals as a last resort. Within each group, picks are tier-ranked by impact — coaching behavior, accessibility, and admin UX move first. Volume isn't a tie-breaker against authored issues: a one-line concrete report from a contributor beats a 50-instance log error.
3. The pilot opens a PR that references the issue with `Fixes #N`. When that PR merges, **the issue author is credited as a co-author** on the merge commit (via `Co-Authored-By:` trailer), so they appear as a repository contributor.

To make your issue actionable:

- Name something concrete: an exact string/copy change, a specific error message or screenshot, or a named component plus observed-vs-expected behavior. Vague reports ("make X better", "headings need updating") get routed to `needs-info`.
- For UI bugs: include the URL/page, what you did, what you expected, what happened, browser, role (learner/admin), and a screenshot if visible.
- For copy or content fixes: include the exact current text and the exact replacement.

You don't need a fork, a dev environment, or any code knowledge to file an issue.

## When to skip the issue and write a PR yourself

You're a regular contributor or have direct collaborator access, AND:

- You're building a plugin (lighter review bar — see below).
- You're addressing an issue you opened that's been triaged but not picked up yet.
- The change is so specific (e.g. fixing an obvious typo in a doc) that the issue + pilot detour adds friction.

Otherwise, file an issue first — the pilot is faster than the round trip of a PR review for small changes, and you still get credit.

> **Are you building a plugin?** Plugins live in `plugins/<id>/` and have a lighter review bar than core changes. Read [docs/plugins/AUTHORING.md](docs/plugins/AUTHORING.md) (humans) or [docs/plugins/AGENTS.md](docs/plugins/AGENTS.md) (AI agents) — you don't need to read the full core-contribution guide. Run `node scripts/create-plato-plugin.js my-plugin` to scaffold one.

## Plugin vs. core changes

Plato has two contribution surfaces with different review bars:

| Change type | Where | Review bar |
|---|---|---|
| Plugin (new or modify) | `plugins/<id>/` | Manifest validates? No core invariants violated? Has its own tests? Ship. |
| Core | Everything else | Architectural review, public-contract impact, more thorough review. |

Use a branch naming convention to make this clear:

- Plugin work: `plugin/<id>/<feature>` (e.g. `plugin/slack/channel-filtering`)
- Core work: `feat/<area>` or `fix/<area>` (e.g. `feat/lesson-pacing-banner`)

### Adding a new extension point

If a plugin you're building genuinely cannot use existing extension points, **don't patch core from inside the plugin folder**. Instead:

1. File an `extension-point-request` issue (template in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`).
2. Wait for maintainer triage — extension points are part of the public plugin contract.
3. Once approved, the bar for adding the extension point is:
   - One real plugin must use it (no speculative slots/hooks)
   - Update [docs/plugins/EXTENSION_REFERENCE.md](docs/plugins/EXTENSION_REFERENCE.md) atomically
   - Update the capability enum in [docs/plugins/plugin.schema.json](docs/plugins/plugin.schema.json)
   - Update the type in `packages/plugin-sdk/index.d.ts`
   - Add a test in `server/tests/lib/plugins/registry.test.js` proving the new capability gates correctly
   - Bump `PLUGIN_API_VERSION` per [docs/plugins/API_VERSIONING.md](docs/plugins/API_VERSIONING.md)

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm

### Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd client && npm install
   cd ../server && npm install
   ```
3. Build the client (the server serves the built files):
   ```bash
   cd client && npm run build
   ```
4. Set up your API key:
   ```bash
   cd server && cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your Anthropic API key
   ```
5. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   node dev-sqlite.js
   ```
6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). On first visit you'll create an admin account. Content is seeded automatically.

No Docker, AWS credentials, or external services needed for local development. AI features require an Anthropic API key (or a Bedrock connection if you set `AI_PROVIDER=bedrock`) — without one, the app is fully navigable but you can't start lesson conversations.

The client uses **Tailwind CSS v4** and **shadcn/ui** for styling. UI components are in `src/components/ui/`.

## Development workflow

- **Client:** `cd client && npm run dev` starts Vite's dev server with HMR. For production builds: `npm run build`.
- **Server:** `cd server && node dev-sqlite.js` starts the API with a local SQLite database. Changes require restarting the server.
- **Tests:** `npm test` in either `client/` or `server/` runs that package's tests. Run both with `npm test` from the root.

### Key files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `client/js/storage.js` | Data layer — all reads/writes go through here (API-backed with in-memory cache) |
| `client/js/orchestrator.js` | AI agent orchestration — loads prompts, assembles context, streams responses |
| `client/js/lessonOwner.js` | Lesson loading and markdown parsing |
| `client/src/lib/lessonEngine.js` | The learning loop state machine (phases, messages, KB updates) |
| `server/src/routes/sync.js` | Data sync endpoints (per-user key-value store with optimistic locking) |
| `server/src/routes/admin.js` | Admin API (users, invites, content management) |
| `server/src/routes/content.js` | Content API (prompts, lessons, knowledge base, branding) |

### Content management

Prompts are bundled in `client/prompts/` and upserted to the database on every server startup — admins cannot edit them directly. Lessons in `client/data/lessons/` are seeded on first setup. The knowledge base is created by admins through the conversational KB Editor agent in the Customizer.

## Activity constraints

Activities generated by the coach must:

- Be completable entirely in the browser
- Lead to one visible result on one page
- End with "Upload an image of your work." or "Hit Submit to submit your response."
- Not reference desktop apps, terminals, or file system operations
- Not use platform-specific keyboard shortcuts or DevTools
- Take 5 minutes or less

## Adding a new lesson

plato is a [microlearning](https://philosophers.group/platos-microlearning/) platform. Lessons are designed to be completable in ~11 exchanges (~20 minutes). This means:

- **One exemplar** — a single, concrete outcome the learner produces
- **2-4 learning objectives** — each starting with "Can", assessable by an AI coach
- The system enforces these limits at creation time (client and server validation)

Limits are defined in `client/src/lib/constants.js` (`MAX_EXCHANGES`, `MIN_OBJECTIVES`, `MAX_OBJECTIVES`).

1. Create a markdown file following the format:
   ```markdown
   # Lesson Title

   Brief description of what the learner will achieve.

   ## Exemplar

   The mastery-level work product the learner is working toward.

   ## Learning Objectives

   - Can first objective
   - Can second objective
   - Can third objective
   ```
2. Add it via the admin dashboard at `/plato/lessons`, or place it in `client/data/lessons/` and re-run the seed script.

## Guidelines

- **Accessibility is required.** Every interactive element must be keyboard-operable and have an accessible name.
- **Keep it minimal.** No heavy frameworks, unnecessary abstractions, or speculative features.
- **No telemetry.** No analytics, tracking, or data collection beyond what's needed for the app to function.
- **Update docs.** If your change affects architecture, add/remove features, or change the development workflow, update the relevant documentation.
- **Test prompts.** When editing system prompts, test with a real AI connection to verify the agent returns valid output.

## Running tests

```bash
# Client tests
cd client && npm test

# Server tests
cd server && npm test

# Both
cd /path/to/plato && npm test
```

Tests use Node's built-in test runner. All tests must pass before merging.

## Submitting changes

The `main` branch is protected — direct pushes are not allowed. All changes go through pull requests. Merging requires one approving review and a passing `review` status check.

1. Create a branch from `main`.
2. Make focused, well-described commits.
3. Run tests — they must pass.
4. **Open the pull request as a Draft** while you iterate (see below).
5. When the PR is genuinely ready, mark it as Ready for review.

### Open PRs as Draft while iterating

If you're working interactively — testing in a browser, getting feedback from a reviewer, tweaking UX — open the PR as **Draft** (`gh pr create --draft`, or use the dropdown when creating in the GitHub UI). Push commits as you iterate without re-running the full review pipeline on every micro-change.

Mark the PR as Ready (`gh pr ready <n>`, or "Ready for review" in the UI) only when you actually want a review. The automated `claude[bot]` reviewer skips draft PRs and runs once you flip the PR to Ready.

If a Ready PR is already open and you discover more iteration is needed, convert it back to Draft (`gh pr ready <n> --undo`).

### Automated review

When you mark a PR as Ready (or push to a PR that's already Ready), the Code Review workflow (`.github/workflows/code-review.yml`) runs an automated reviewer (`claude[bot]`) that reads the diff, runs the server test suite, and posts a single `gh pr review` call. The workflow is per-commit idempotent: each HEAD sha is reviewed at most once, and re-runs on the same sha are no-ops. Pushing new commits to a Ready PR produces fresh reviews. Draft PRs are skipped — the workflow exits before invoking the reviewer.

The `review` status check must pass before merging.

One caveat: if your PR modifies `.github/workflows/code-review.yml` itself, the action's own security check will fail the `review` status because the workflow file on the branch differs from the one on `main`. That failure is expected on workflow-editing PRs and requires maintainer bypass to merge.

### Automated PRs (plato-pilot)

You may see PRs opened by a scheduled agent called "plato-pilot" (branch prefix `pilot/`, label `plato-pilot`). These are autonomous small fixes proposed from KPI and log analysis or from `ready-for-pilot` issues. plato-pilot PRs are opened as Ready for review by design — they're standalone proposals, not collaborative iteration loops. If the auto-review requests changes, a companion workflow (`revise.yml`) tags the PR with `plato-pilot-revised` to prevent re-runs and then makes a one-shot fixup commit addressing the feedback — any further changes require human review.

When a pilot PR addresses an issue (`Fixes #N` in the body), the commit message includes a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer crediting the issue author so they appear as a contributor on the repository when the PR merges.

### Automated issue intake

When you open a new issue, the intake agent (`.github/workflows/issue-intake.yml`) reads it and picks one of three outcomes:

- **Enough detail** — adds the `ready-for-pilot` label and a short acknowledgement. plato-pilot or a human will pick it up.
- **Needs more info** — adds the `needs-info` label and posts up to 3 focused clarifying questions. Reply inline when you can.
- **Spam, off-topic, or abusive** — closes the issue with a polite comment explaining why and inviting you to reopen if we got it wrong. Vague or low-effort issues are *not* treated as spam — those go to `needs-info`.

If you reopen a closed issue, or reopen an issue after adding the details we asked for, the intake agent re-runs and re-classifies.

To file the most useful bug reports up front: include the URL / page, what you did, what you expected, what happened, any error message or screenshot, and your browser + role (learner / admin). The intake agent only asks for things you (the reporter) can provide — it won't ask you to inspect code.

### After merge

When a PR is merged to `main`, a new `Beta-RC-N` git tag and GitHub release are created automatically. Version is tag-based — `version.json` is not tracked in git.
